# CNOPS Logo Integration

## Step 1: Save the Logo Image

Please save the CNOPS logo image you provided to:
`public/logos/cnops-logo.png`

The image should be saved in PNG format for best quality with transparency.

## Alternative: If you prefer SVG format
Save as: `public/logos/cnops-logo.svg`

---

Once saved, the website will automatically display the official CNOPS logo instead of the emoji icon.
